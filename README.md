## Programming assignment for Machine Learning class

This repo has two branches: the main branch, and a "gh-pages"
branch with the compiled HTML output. Switch to that branch
to see the results of running the Rmd script here.

If you download pa.Rmd with the intention of running it, be
sure to download the data directory as well, so that you 
will have the necessary input data. Also, you will need a
"results" directory for the script to output to. (This
repository has this directory, but not the generated files
themselves.)
